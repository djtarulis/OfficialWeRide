    <h1>Sponsorships</h1>
    <p>
        Let me begin by thanking you in advance.  Without generous sponsors our mission and goals can be difficult to reach.
    </p>
    <p>
        We Ride is a non-for-profit 501C3 Association.  We are dedicated to making Miracles happen for Riley Children of NWI.
        We Ride has a wide range of fund-raising events to help accomplish our goals.
    </p>  
        
    <p>
        We host Bingos, have bake sales, Texas 
        Holdem Tournaments, and concerts.  All of which take a lot of time and money to coordinate.  Donations help us keep 
        the cost at a minimum so that all of the proceeds get donated to Riley Children's Hospital annually, in June.
        I am humbly asking for a donation to help us cover the cost of hosting events.  Please consider one of the donation 
        amounts below.  And thank you again for your consideration!
    </p>
        <p> Bronze level donation	$100  </p>

        <p> Silver level donation	$250  </p>          
            
        <p> Gold level donation		$500  </p>
